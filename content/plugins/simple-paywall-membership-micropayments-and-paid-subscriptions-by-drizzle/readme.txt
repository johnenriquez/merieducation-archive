Simple plugin for bloggers and publishers to monetize premium content with 2 user-friendly, one-click options: micropayments and paid subscriptions. 

== Description ==

This plugin is a full-stack solution for pro bloggers and publishers to start monetizing their best content directly from website visitors. Once installed, you have your own membership, paywall, lead generation, payment, purchase analytics and dynamic revenue-maximizing systems.

This plugin will let you paywall virtually any content in your posts. You can paywall text, images, videos, links, and any HTML-elements. Your website visitors will be offered to pay for your content with just one-click, either in a "pay-as-you-go" fashion via micropayments or via paid subscriptions.

The plugin works with a simple shortcode:


[paywall] Your great content. [/paywall]

Text attribute allows you to set a unique call-to-action on any paywall.
The starting price for any content is 20 cents. As more visitors recommend your content, the price increases dynamically to maximize your revenue. Maximum price is 80 cents.

If you are a pro blogger or publisher who creates great content which people love, then keep reading. This plugin allows you to:

1. Paywall virtually any content: text, podcast, images, video, etc. Website visitors are one-click away from signing up and one-click away from paying for your content. Visitors are offered 2 user-friendly, one-click payment options: either a single micropayment or a recurring subscription payment.

1. Pick the best performing content. Not sure which content to paywall? Not a problem. The performance of each content you paywall is monitored, and if the content underperforms, the paywall will be removed automatically. Just specify the number of $ you want to earn per 1000 impressions. 

1. Pick the price. Not sure how to price your content? Not a problem. Every paywalled content gets a default price. If your content performs well, the price is increased automatically to maximize your revenue. The price has 3 tiers: $0.20, $0.40, $0.80. Tier is dynamically adjusted based on content's popularity.

The content's popularity strongly depends on 2 metrics: the number of people who purchased, the number of people who recommended and the number of people who shared the content.

1. Set up paid subscriptions with just one click. Choose a $5, $10 or $20 per month plan.

1. Keep all your users' information. When a registered Drizzle user interacts with your content, you keep the user's name, email and other applicable attributes, such as purchase history. Seamless lead generation!

1. Promote your content by allowing users who purchased your content to share it for free with their friends via email. 

1. Upsell your best content on your website and other websites in Drizzle's network. Registered users on your website can easily see a list of the top recommended and top similar content on your website. If your content does really well, your content may go viral and be featured on other websites in the Drizzle network.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I monetize my content directly? =

Direct monetization can serve as a complement to a website’s existing streams of revenue. We’ve learned that website visitors love to pay for high quality content, but they want to do so in simple, user-friendly way. There’s no need to alter any existing revenue sources, such as sponsored content or banner ads. With Drizzle, you’ll also learn which content your users value most, gain an effective new source of lead generation, and upsell your content to more engaged audiences. Your top performing content can generate up to $20 per 1000 impressions. Compare that to ads, with only $2 CPM.

= Do I get my users' information? =

Yes, you do. Any time a website visitor interacts with your content, either via payment, subscription, recommendation or “get for free” actions, you will get that user’s name, email address and other applicable attributes.

= How much of my content will be considered premium? =

You have to make an educated guess on whether your content will sell well once it’s paywalled. We strongly suggest you keep most of your content free and paywall unique content only, the kind of content people cannot find anywhere else but your website. Once website visitors start interacting your paywalled content, the plugin will closely monitor the performance of that content. If the content underperforms - the paywall is automatically removed. The plugin calculates performance based on a combination of the number of people who recommended the content and the number people who purchased the content.

= Can I use this plugin for lead generation? =

Yes, we’re so glad you asked! The plugin doubles as a lead generation tool by giving you the name, email address, and purchase history of users who purchase your paywalled content.

= What type of payments does this plugin offer? =

The plugin allows publishers to choose between a-la-carte or paid subscriptions. Bloggers and publishers can offer both options to their website visitors. A-la-carte paywalls mean that users micropay for each individual piece of content they’d like to access, whereas subscriptions mean that users pay a monthly fee to access all of a website’s premium content.


= I already receive revenue from banner ads. Will I be forced to forfeit that if I sign up with this plugin? =

Nope. The beauty of Drizzle is that it serves as a complement to your existing revenue streams. We recognize that most content makers lose banner ad revenue due to the popularity of Adblock.
