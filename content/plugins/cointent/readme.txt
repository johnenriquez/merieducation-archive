####Services 
#####Subscriptions
> Give users access to premium content on your site with weekly, monthly and yearly subscriptions.  
#####Micropayments 
> Sell access to individual pieces of content for $0.05-$1.00. Micropayments drastically increase the number of paying users on your site, since they attract more engaged viewers who may not be ready to subscribe, but still want to access your premium content to fully enjoy your site.
 
#####Micropayment Wallet 
> CoinTent uses a digital wallet to make micropayments easy. The wallet provides: 
* Optimized 1-click purchases for your consumers *
 Lower credit card fees since consumers fund their wallet in advance

== Frequently Asked Questions ==  
= How does CoinTent work? = 
Publishers install the CoinTent plugin and determine the content they’d like to sell, and the price they'd like to charge. The plugin blocks access to the content, and displays a button that allows users to pay for the content. Consumers with an account can purchase content with one click. Consumers without an account can sign-up for an account and fund their wallet while staying on your website, and then continue to purchase content without disrupting the user experience. You can sign up for a publisher account at [CoinTent.com](https://cointent.com/p/signup?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_term=readme&utm_campaign=faq

= What content can I sell? = 
You can sell any content (articles, blog posts, videos, etc.).  Just wrap the content you want to hide in the "cointent_lockedcontent" shortcode and any content before the more tag will be paywalled. More information is available in our [documentation](https://cointent.com/docs/wordpress?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_term=readme&utm_campaign=documentation).  
= How do I make an article available for sale? = 
There are two ways to designate an article for sale. You can either pick a WordPress category and make all posts in that category for sale, or you can add the CoinTent shortcode to the individual article you want to sell. More information is available in our [documentation](https://cointent.com/docs/wordpress?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_term=readme&utm_campaign=documentation).

 = Why do I have to agree to tracking? = 
Tracking is core to reporting your financial success.  Data from your individual visitors is anonymous and aggregated, yet helps you test different prices and see what content people are most willing to pay for.  CoinTent tracks views of posts, clicks on purchase buttons, and clicks on users logging in. CoinTent uses that data to compare against the number of readers that sign up for our service, and to guide our choices on the appropriate presentation of the checkout process. CoinTent also uses this data to make sure  that there are no bugs in the product; changes in the numbers help us see bugs even before they are reported so we can fix them before they affect many users. CoinTent does not sell your data to any third parties; it is used to make our product the best it can be and to help your business.

Yes, your CoinTent publisher account serves as your dashboard for setting prices for your articles, monitoring your sales, and requesting a payment of your balance.  A publisher account also allows us to keep you informed of our Terms of Service. You can sign up on [CoinTent.com](https://cointent.com/p/signup?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_term=readme&utm_campaign=faq).  
= Do my readers need to create a CoinTent Account? = 
Yes. This way  CoinTent can remember which articles your readers have purchased, and bill them for subscriptions. The wallet also allows you to set prices lower than a $1.

When your information is properly filled out, we will pay your account monthly by check as long as you have accumulated a minimum of $10.
